# Blender Addon Release Action

This GitHub Action is designed to automatically create a release of the Blender add-on and upload .zip file to it.
Action requires the add-on to be previously build and uploaded as artifact using [Blender Addon Build](https://github.com/BlenderKit/blender-addon-build) action or [Upload Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.

## üöÄ Features

- Automated zipping of Blender Addon artifacts.
- Dynamic naming convention based on the stage of release and other inputs.
- Supports multiple release stages including: alpha, beta, rc (release candidate), and gold (final public release).

## üìù Notes

It's important to note that this action is designed to be used in conjunction with the [Blender Addon Build](https://github.com/BlenderKit/blender-addon-build) action.
Make sure to run the Build job before the Release job.
Or run custom build job and finish it by uploading the zip file as artifact using the [Upload Artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) action.
